Welcome to my page!

First, let's start off by setting up an ssh connection between Eclipse and GitHub.
(This is important to do so we can make commits!)

You can save the ssh-keys in any folder on your computer.

In the terminal, type<br>
`ssh-keygen -b 2048 -t rsa` <br>
The following prompts will follow: <br>
`Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user/sshfolder/id_rsa): `  if location is correct, press enter.<br>
`Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):` Not required, but if it is, remember it forever.

 Congrats! You have just generated a private and a public(.pub) key!

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/mscheuer92/mscheuer92.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
